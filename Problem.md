Project Problem Statement.

There are several things I want to implement in this project, the first one would be several puzzle games, where each game is required to be completed in order to open a chest. the details on these puzzle games would be that there should be two to four minigames in total. one game will be sudoku, another mini game will be a waterpipe minigame that you need to find the right configuration of pipes so the water comes through. The third would be a ping pong like minigame where you will need to destroy all the blocks in order to finish the game.

Pong like game:


The second mechanic that I want to implement is raytracing the light emitted by the lantern on the playerâ€™s hands. where I will need to use several techniques to figure out where to actually draw the map elements, or make them brighter.
Meanwhile the scope of the product is to entertain the user, it is also to make them use their heads when they are playing it. 
Another mechanic I want to implement is an enemy that is going to be chasing you at all times and you will have to run so It does not capture you.
on the chests mentioned above, there will be some keys to open the next level. Sometimes these chests will contain powerups like having a bullet in your gun so you can kill the enemy, or a puzzle skip.
The game will be top down view and will use tilemaps to create the map where the character will be in.
